# Project Using Whisper Timestamped Server

This project utilizes [whisper-timestamped-server](https://github.com/idashevskii/whisper-timestamped-server) for processing audio with Whisper and obtaining word-level timestamps.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the whisper-timestamped-server repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/idashevskii/whisper-timestamped-server.git
   cd whisper-timestamped-server
   ```

2. Launch the server locally using Docker Compose:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. After successful launch, determine the hostname or IP address on which the server is running.

4. In the `.env` file of your main project, locate the `WHISPER_BASE_URL=` line and replace the value with the address of your locally running server. For example:
   ```
   WHISPER_BASE_URL=http://localhost:9001
   ```
   or
   ```
   WHISPER_BASE_URL=http://192.168.1.100:9001
   ```

5. Save the changes to the `.env` file.

## Usage

Your project is now configured to use the locally running whisper-timestamped-server. You can continue working with your main application, which will communicate with this server for audio processing and timestamp retrieval.



## Note

Ensure that the whisper-timestamped-server is running and accessible before using your main application.
